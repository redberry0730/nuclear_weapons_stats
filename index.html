            The <span class="color_phrase2">Most Dangerous</span> Weapon Ever

          </h2>
          <h4>
            Why Reducing the Risk of Nuclear War Should Be a Serious Concern
          </h4>
          <p>
            Nuclear weapons are the most dangerous weapons on earth. No weapon
            is more destructive and there is no way to know and control how far
            radioactive fallout will disseminate or how temporary these effects
            will be.
          </p>

          <br />
          <p>
            <strong>Destruction and Death: </strong> Nuclear weapons can destroy
            a whole city, kill millions of people, and jeopardize the natural
            environment and future generations through its long-term
            catastrophic effects.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Nuclear fallout: </strong> Tens of thousands would suffer
            terrible injuries and slowly die from radiation exposure. Residual
            radioactive material propelled into the upper atmosphere and
            expanded over major areas of the world from where it fell down. The
            amount and spread of fallout correlates to the size of the weapon
            and the altitude at which it is detonated. Fallout may get carried
            along with the products of a pyrocumulus cloud and fall as black
            rain within the hour.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Nuclear Winter/famine: </strong> The earth’s ecosystem and
            reduced global temperatures can lead to food shortage all over the
            world. Cities will burn at an intense rate and create a firestorm,
            which fans the flames and causes extreme heat. Immense smoke and
            soot will rise way up into the stratosphere and spread across the
            globe, blocking sunlight. Since it is at a great height, it will
            remain there for many years to come, making the whole sky dark and
            handicapping our agriculture, ecosystem, and temperature.
          </p>

          <p>
            The possibilities of global devastation and mass extinction are what
            makes Nuclear war so alarming. A nuclear war cannot be won because
            it can lead to self-destruction.

          <h3>Country Position on Nuclear Weapons Over Time</h3>
          <p>
            With that in mind, disarmament is still possible. Let’s take a
            closer look. The map shows the countries with nuclear capabilities,
            which includes the United states, Russia, United Kingdom, France,
            China, India, Pakistan, Israel, and North Korea. Specifically, it
            looks at the country’s position on nuclear weapons broken down into
            four categories: does not consider, considers, pursues, and
            possesses over time from 1945 to 2022. As the year progresses, the
            amount of variety of the hue is the most around the 1980s, which
            demonstrates more and more countries exploring and pursuing nuclear
            weapons. However, the variety of hue diminished as we approached the
            1990s, which illustrates steadiness and that countries did not
            continue to explore and pursue nuclear weapons.

          <h1>Our Approach to Analyzing and Visualizing the Datasets</h1>

          <p>
            When choosing a dataset to analyze, we wanted to pick something that
            is beneficial for society or provide insights about perplexing
            trends that are hard to see with the naked eye. After looking at
            multiple datasets, we agreed on the topic of Nuclear Weapons because
            Nuclear weapons are the most dangerous weapons and the consequences
            of a nuclear war are detrimental to humanity and Earth.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our purpose is to simplify the dataset by focusing on certain
            factors to identify patterns that may help describe, explain, and
            predict. Through this project, we want to inform everyone about
            potential efforts to reduce the risks of a nuclear war. We will be
            taking a look at how the number of nuclear warheads change over time
            and concrete measures taken by each country in helping to reduce the
            risk of a nuclear war from breaking out.
          </p>
          <p>
            Before making any visualizations with the data, we cleaned up the
            datasets by taking into account any missing values or unnecessary
            data. We removed certain columns that had much to do with our
            questions or hypotheses.
          </p>
          <p>
            We chose to use a variety of graphs, each to their advantage in the
            type of data we want to show. We implemented a horizontal bar chart,
            stacked bar chart, choropleth map, and stacked area chart. We chose
            to use a horizontal bar chart because the data is categorical and to
            show frequency distribution. Bar chart is useful to compare
            different categorical or discrete variables. Stacked chart bar
            charts are best used when showing comparisons between categories,
            which is suitable for comparing countries with the number of nuclear
            warheads split into four categories. Furthermore, choropleth maps
            use color to show how data changes from place to place, which is
            suitable for visualizing information tied to geography, and to
            compare and analyze data and trends from across locations/countries.
            Lastly, stacked-area charts can track not only the total value, but
            also the breakdown of that total by groups. This is helpful when we
            want to compare the heights of each segment of the curve according
            to a particular country and allows us to get a general idea of how
            each subgroup compares to the other in their contributions to the
            total number of nuclear warheads.
          </p>

          <h3>A Deeper Breakdown</h3>
          <p>
            Roughly 90 percent of all nuclear warheads are owned by Russia and
            the United States, who each have around 4,000 warheads in their
            military stockpiles. In contrast, the rest of the countries do not
            see a need for more than a couple hundred nuclear weapons to ensure
            national security.
          </p>
          <p>
            To better understand the proliferation of nuclear weapons is to
            quantify the stockpiles the countries have. An important note is
            that the stacked area chart shown does not include retired warheads
            awaiting dismantlement. Thus, the total inventories of nuclear
            warheads is larger than what is shown in the chart. Since the United
            States and Russia’s military power are so much more advanced
            compared to that of the rest of the world, there is a huge gap
            between the two leading military powers and the other countries. As
            a result, it might be beneficial to look at the stockpiles of
            nuclear weapons between Russia and the United States in one chart,
            and compare the rest of the countries in another chart. For both
            charts, they illustrate the total number of stockpiled nuclear
            weapons for the respective countries peaked between 1980 and 1990.
            Notice the difference between the scales for the y-axis, this shows
            how much more powerful the US and Russia are. Within the stacked
            area chart without Russia and the US, it is evident that UK, France,
            and China have the most total number of nuclear weapons over the
            years.

          <h5>Nuclear Inventory Breakdowns</h5>

          <p>
            Despite the United States’ effort to dramatically reduce its
            non-strategic nuclear weapons after the Cold War, the combined
            inventory of nuclear warheads of the whole world remains at a very
            high level. The majority of the ownerships falls into nine
            countries, possessing roughly 12,700 warheads as of early-2022.
            Russia maintains a large amount and variety of non-strategic nuclear
            warheads. People are concerned that Russia might intend on using
            these in conflicts. The US military maintains more reserve strategic
            warheads.
          </p>

          <p>
            It is estimated that of the world’s 12,700 nuclear warheads, more
            than 9,400 are in the military stockpiles for use by missiles,
            aircraft, ships and submarines. The remaining warheads have been
            retired but are still intact and waiting for dismantlement. Looking
            at the stacked bar chart, Of the 12,700 total nuclear warheads, some
            3,730 are deployed on missiles or bomber bases, which is a
            combination of strategic and non-strategic warheads. US, Russian, UK
            and French warheads are all on high alert, ready for use in
            emergencies.
          </p>

          <p>
            Russia has a clear numerical advantage in non-deployed strategic
            warheads, while the US has a numerical advantage in non-strategic
            nuclear warheads. To promote reduction of nuclear weapons, the
            United States and Russia could negotiate an agreement with an
            aggregate limit covering all their nuclear warheads and could offset
            reductions in the categories in which the country has advantage in.

          <h5>Estimated Nuclear Warhead Inventories, 2022</h5>
          <p>
            Strategic warheads are designed to be used in settled territory far
            from the battlefield as part of a strategic plan. Deployed are those
            on ballistic missiles or bomber bases. Retired are those awaiting
            dismantlement.
